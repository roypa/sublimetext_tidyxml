Formatting XML in Sublime Text 2 using xmllint

Based upon this blog post: http://www.bergspot.com/blog/2012/05/formatting-xml-in-sublime-text-2-xmllint/

## Installation

To be able to use this plugin you need xmllint, which is provided by default in OS X and Linux.
I guess ut would be possible to install it in Cygwin in Windows.

To install the plugin
1. Go to your Sublime Text plugins directory
** To find it, you can open Sublime Text and then: Preferences -> Browse packages...
1. Clone the git repo into a folder "Tidy XML":
   ```git clone git@github.com:roypa/sublimetext_tidyxml.git "Tidy XML"```
1. Done, now select XML and press Cmd + K, Cmd + F (OS X)
